{Python Interview Questions on Data Types}

1.What are Data Types?

Ans>A data type is a set of values and a set of operations defined on data. 
An implementation of a data type is an expression of data 
and operations in terms of a specific programming language such as Java, C ++, or Python.

2.Name four of the main data types in Python?

Ans>Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files

3.Why are these data types known as Python’s core data types?

Ans>They are known as the core data types because they are part of the Python language itself and are always available to create other objects, 
you usually need to call functions in imported modules.

4.What does immutable mean and what three types of Python core data types are considered immutable?

Ans> An immutable data type is a type of object which cannot be modified after its creation.
Numbers, strings, and tuples in Python fall into this category. Although you cannot modify an immutable object in place, 
you can always create a new one by running an expression.

5.What does mapping mean and what kind of data type is based on mapping?

Ans> The term mapping refers to an object that maps keys to associated values. The Python dictionary is the only type of mapping in the base typeset. 
Mappings do not maintain any left-to-right position order; they support access to stored data by key, as well as type-specific method calls.

{Python Interview Questions on conditional Statements}

Question 1.
What constitutes “True” in Python?

Answer:
A true expression is any expression that does not evaluate to 0, the empty list [ ], tuple ( ), dictionary { } or the objects None or False.

Question 2:
What are the three main conditional statements in Python?

Answer:
if, elif, and else

Question 3:
What are the comparison operators in Python?

Answer:
< Less than, > Greater than, <= Less than or equal to, >= Greater than or equal to, = Equal to, != not equal,
 o alternative not equal. Note a single = is NOT a Python comparison operator, it is an assignment operator only.

Question 4:
Illustrate a basic if, elif, else structure.

Answer:
if <condition>:

elif<another condition>:

else:

Question 5:
In Python 2.5+, the equivalent of a tertiary operator has been added to the language. Provide an example of its use.

Answer:
myValue = ‘Positive’ if myNumber > 0 else ‘Negative or Zero’
